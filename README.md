1. Model's Building.ipynb

This notebook is dedicated to the process of training and evaluating machine learning models. Key highlights include:

Data Preprocessing: Cleaning and preparing the dataset for modeling.

Model Training: Implementing several machine learning algorithms such as Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Support Vector Machines.

Model Evaluation: Using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to assess performance.

Hyperparameter Tuning: Leveraging techniques like GridSearchCV to optimize model performance.

The notebook ensures reproducibility and provides a clear workflow for building models from raw data to evaluation.

2. Feature Selection.ipynb

This notebook focuses on selecting the most relevant features to improve model performance and reduce complexity. Key sections include:

Feature Importance Analysis: Using techniques like correlation matrices and feature importance scores from tree-based models.

Dimensionality Reduction: Applying PCA (Principal Component Analysis) to reduce the feature space while retaining maximum variance.

Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE): Iteratively selecting features based on model performance.

The notebook demonstrates how to balance performance improvement with computational efficiency.
